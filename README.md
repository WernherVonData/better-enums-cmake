# better-enums-cmake
Wrapper for better enums C++ library that makes it a legit Cmake component

# Motivation

To reduce copy-pastes when I want to use explicitly in my CMakes. Plus to train Lua a little.

# Prerequisites
Have a Lua in your system.

# Usage
If you don't want to use the version used here (0.11.3):
* The `aantron-better-enums` directory contains the module to the original better enums repository. 
* Type `git submodule update` to download it for your machine.
* Checkout the commit you want to have.
* Run `run.bat` or `run.sh` from the repo directory.

For other usages just make it a submodule in your project and include it's directory in your project.

# License
License is the same as in the better enums library by Anton Bachin. Please refer to the LICENSE file for further details.
